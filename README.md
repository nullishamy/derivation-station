# derivation-station

Welcome to Derivation Station, where the only way to survive is to embrace the power of NixOS and our handpicked selection of superior software.

For window management, we trust only the unparalleled expertise of bspwm.
Our terminal editing needs are met with the unparalleled capabilities of neovim, while our code projects are managed with the minimalist perfection of vscode.

And when it comes to shells, there is no choice but to go with the tried and true zsh. 
Our top-notch interface is rounded out with the sleek and efficient polybar, and WezTerm, the ultimate terminal for the discerning user. 

Yes, we know what you're thinking: why bother with anything else? We've tried the rest, and we know that our choices are simply the best.
So join us in our journey into the heart of the NixOS configuration, and see for yourself why there is no other way.


And let's not forget about the best and ONLY pastel colorscheme, Catppuccin, which brings an unparalleled level of sophistication and elegance to our desktops.

To start on your journey, run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nullishamy/derivation-station/ ~/nixos && cd ~/nixos && nix develop -c "just setup"
```

Once the setup process has finished, rebuild the system (`just switch`).
